# Noted
_Organize for the home together._

### Overview
- A UX design project for my UX design course (spring 2017)
- Objective is to figure out a problem related to the home, and design an app solving that problem.
  - I came up with the problem after conducting surveys and doing further research related to the survey topics.
  - I then conducted the UX design process; designing, getting feedback, then designing with that feedback.
  - Final result is a fully designed, working prototype. 

_Note: Original presentation for this project is done on Google Slides. I created this repository for the sake of having the assets on my GitHub.

## Finding the problem

### Quantitative survey

I conducted a small survey and had about 10 people participate. 
Survey questions asks participants about their cohabitual shopping habits and some cohabitual living habits. 

These are the results for each question:

### Further research and analysis

After conducting the survey, I compiled a survey results analysis: 

<img alt="Survey results summary" src="/1%20-%20Finding%20the%20Problem/a%20-%20Quantitative%20Survey/surveyanalysis.jpg">

* Most want to buy things for their room/home. `~ 75%`
* Most forget what to buy when grocery shopping → buys more than needed. `~ 75% - 87%`
* Most do not use shopping lists. `~ 60%`
 *`~ 33%` think it’s a hassle. 
* Most have housemates do shopping for them. `~ 87%`
* More than half forget to do chores. `~ 60%`
* Chores mostly done by housemates.
* `~ 33%` of their housemates forget.

Along with conducting the survey, I've also looked into a few sources to serve as resources for basing problem statements. 

I've found some of these statistics online with their respective source:

I've also looked into other existing apps, and did a competitive analysis. Through competitive analysis, I look at features existing, similar apps have and compare with the app I'm designing.

## Formulize a problem statement

After conducting my survey and doing some further research, I formulated a problem statement addressing people living and shopping for their co-habitants: 

**Problem statement:**

> **Families and roommates need an easy way to have digital collaborative lists because they want to better organize what’s bought and what’s done for their home.**

This problem statement serves as a guide and reminder for designing the app. It serves to let me know that my app will be a solution to this problem.
