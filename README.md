# Noted
_Organize for the home together._

### Overview
- A UX design project for my UX design course (spring 2017)
- Objective is to figure out a problem related to the home, and design an app solving that problem.
  - I came up with the problem after conducting surveys and doing further research related to the survey topics.
  - I then conducted the UX design process; designing, getting feedback, then designing with that feedback.
  - Final result is a fully designed, working prototype. 

_Note: Original presentation for this project is done on Google Slides. I created this repository for the sake of having it on my GitHub.

## Finding the problem

### Quantitative survey

I conducted a small survey and had about 10 people participate. 
Survey questions asks participants about their cohabitual shopping habits and some cohabitual living habits. 

These are the results for each question:

### Further research and analysis

After conducting the survey, I compiled a survey results analysis:
