_Organize for the home together._

### Overview
- A UX design project for my UX design course (spring 2017)
- Objective is to figure out a problem related to the home, and design an app solving that problem.
  - I came up with the problem after conducting surveys and doing further research related to the survey topics.
  - I then conducted the UX design process; designing, getting feedback, then designing with that feedback.
  - Final result is a fully designed, working prototype.
